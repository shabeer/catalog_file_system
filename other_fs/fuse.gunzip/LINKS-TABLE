FuseCompress
http://www.miio.net/fusecompress/

FuseCompress is an approach that uses lzo, gzip, and bzip2 compression
to create a filesystem that provides both transparent compression
and decompression of files.

Boons:
Emphasis on compression.
Caching when compressed files are decompressed.
Transparent compression of modified files.
Future support planned for p7zip.

Banes:
Not performance oriented.



e2compr
http://e2compr.sourceforge.net/

e2compr provides compression for the ext2 filesystem.

Boons:
It is a true filesystem.

Banes:
It is slow, inefficient, complex, abandonware.
No support for ext3.
No support for linux 2.6
Kernel modification required for installation.



zlibc
http://zlibc.linux.lu/

zlibc's hompeage describes it as:
"This program has (almost) the same effect
as a (read-only) compressed file system."

Boons:
Easy installation

Banes:
Can not decompress executables or libraries.
Will not work with statically linked executables.
No caching so every open of a compressed file
  requires it to be completely decompressed.
Compressed files must have a different name than original.


http://upx.sourceforge.net/
UPX

Provides utilities and library for 
creating and running compressed executables.

Boons:
Easy installation
Support for multiple compression formats.
Support for multiple ELF format.

Banes:
No caching.
  Each run of an executable requires complete decompression of it.
Only works on ELF executables.
One extra ELF library link added per executable compressed.


Summary.
There are a number of projects for providing
forms of transparent decompression for
data files, executables, and libraries.
Most of them are focused on easy installation
and support for multiple compression formats.
The only one designed for optimal performance
for minimal complexity is fuse.gunzip

SATA drives and the following technologies may
put an end to further progress of complex
implementations of compressed filesystems.
However, as long the filesytem norm is to
fragment files there may yet remain a niche
for simple performance boosting overlay filesystems.

caching =	elimination of multiple decompression
		on repeatedly opened compressed files
exec	=	support for compressed executables
lib	=	support for compressed libraries
data	=	support for compressed data files
usr	=	can be used in for /usr filesystem
writing	=	support both reading and writing
		to transparently compressed files
formats	=	provides more than one compression format


Notes:

1.  zlibc and upx have the easiest installations.
However, even when used in combination
they lack support for compressed ELF libraries.

2.  fuse.gunzip and zlibc both use gzip formats without modification.
Therefore, compressed files from both can easily be decompressed
and restored to original when compression is not desired.
