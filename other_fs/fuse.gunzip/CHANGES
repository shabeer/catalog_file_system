Sometimes fuse.gunzip process does not exit 
merely by umounting the fuse.gunzip filesystem.
This is unwanted behavior but normally does not create a problem.
However, sometimes killall5 hangs during execution
when fuse.gunzip process exists.
Therefore, the stop function of the init script now
executes pkill fuse.gunzip to terminate fuse.gunzip
so that killall5 should no longer hang.
Whether the sporadic hang behavior is due to a bug in
killall5 from sysvinit or a bug in fuse is unknown.

Added checks to not attempt to reduce file <= 4096 bytes
and not try to transparently decompress files < 30 bytes.

Moved execution of chown to before chmod in reduce.c
so that SUID and SGID bits are not dropped from file modes.

Automatically reduced cache size from 96M to 32M
when compiling on boxes with less than 250M of RAM.

Modified fuse.gunzip.init to not export FUSE_GUNZIP_SIZE
since using the compile time value is probably best.

Fixed typo in configure potentially preventing proper execution
on x86_64 architecture.

Increased cache size limit from 64M to 96M
Running ldconfig may cycle the cache when
many ELF libraries are reduced.

Modified fuse.gunzip.c so that it sets
the open file resource limit to 65536.
Removed ulimit -n 65536 from startup script.

Added ulimit -n 65536 to startup script so that
the fuse.gunzip does not malfunction after it has
opened more than 1024 files.
Increased sleep delays stop function of init script
to avoid potential hangs during shutdown

Removed requirement on file's libmagic.
Checking for 2 magic bytes at the front of a file
is more quickly and easily done directly.
