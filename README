Status:
--------
This is stable snapshot of project.
Program works perfectly in daemon as well as (Fuse)debug mode.
catalogfsmount file is added to ease, mounting catalog_file using catalogfs.

Todo:
-----
1. Cleanup the catalogfs.c file and add comments, so that it can be released.
2. Write program to generate catalog_file.

Features:
---------
1. Catalog_file contents can be dynamically (properly)changed. 
The program will automatically take the updated catalog_file contents.

Future work:
-------------
Possible extensions:

1.Create one README_CFS file(in root path of Filesystem) in which user can write notes for the catalog.
The user will be open only this file. But cannot write to it.

2.Store & show extended attributes of file.
